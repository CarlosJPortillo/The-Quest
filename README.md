# The-Quest
Lab from Headfirst C# book. This is my completed version of the game. I added a description to the GUI and made the game easier than what was intended with weapons having further range attack values and a blue potion healing for a lot more. I implemented a feature where the weapon that you currently have equipped is highlighted in red, instead of remembering what weapon you have equipped with no indication.
